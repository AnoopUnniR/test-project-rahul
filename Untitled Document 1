Forking and Creating a Pull Request
Forking the Repository:

    Go to the GitHub page of the repository you want to contribute to.
    Click on the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the page.
    This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
    
    
    
    Cloning Your Fork Locally:
 //   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git
 
 
Adding a Remote for the Original Repository:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repository.git


The upstream remote is a convention for referring to the original repository.
// git checkout -b your-feature-branch



Making Changes:

    Make your changes in the branch.
    
    git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

    
Pushing Changes to Your Fork:
git push origin your-feature-branch

Creating a Pull Request:

    Go to your fork on GitHub.
    Switch to the branch you just pushed.
    Click on "New pull request."
    Set the base repository and branch (the repository you forked from and the branch you want to merge into).
    Set the head repository and branch (your fork and the branch where you made changes).
    Create the pull request.
